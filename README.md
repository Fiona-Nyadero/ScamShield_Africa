üöÄ About the Project
ScamShield Africa is an innovative solution designed to combat the growing problem of financial scams targeting non-tech-savvy individuals. Leveraging the ubiquity of WhatsApp across Africa, this project creates an intelligent bot that serves as a personal fraud protector. By using Natural Language Processing (NLP), the bot aggregates complex scam reports and translates them into simple, actionable warnings, empowering users to recognize and avoid financial threats.

Our mission is to bridge the digital literacy gap and provide a simple, accessible line of defense, ensuring that individuals' hard-earned savings are secure.
